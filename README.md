> **KrishiMitra AI** is a production-grade, AI-powered agricultural intelligence platform designed primarily for farmers in **Odisha and across India**. It combines real-device computer vision disease diagnosis, real-time GPS pinpoint weather forecasting, direct marketplace purchasing (Amazon & Flipkart), verified agro-dealer communications, and 5 cutting-edge agricultural AI engines.

## ?? Key Platform Features

### 1. ?? Real Device Camera Crop Diagnosis (`/analyze`)
* Real-time webcam and mobile camera integration via `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`.
* Front/back camera toggle, centered viewfinder leaf overlay, snapshot preview, retake, and confirmation.
* AI Plant Doctor diagnoses with disease identification, severity ratings, symptoms, organic and chemical remedies, and Web Speech audio playback.

### 2. ?? Pinpoint City Geolocation & 5-Day Weather (`/weather`)
* Real-time GPS auto-detection via `navigator.geolocation` with Nominatim reverse geocoding to resolve exact City, District, and State (e.g. *Cuttack, Cuttack District, Odisha*).
* Live temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall probability, and a 5-day agricultural weather forecast with farming advisories.

### 3. ?? Agricultural Marketplace with Direct Links (`/products`)
* Recommended fertilizers, bio-fungicides, and tools with real price tags in Indian Rupees (?).
* **"Amazon"** (Amber) and **"Flipkart"** (Blue) direct buttons opening store search and product pages in new tabs.

### 4. ?? Verified Agro Dealers & Direct Communication (`/dealers`)
* Verified dealer directory across Odisha districts (Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Puri, Sambalpur, Balasore, Ganjam).
* Direct phone call button (`tel:`), direct WhatsApp messaging (`https://wa.me/`), and in-app real-time messaging powered by Socket.IO.

### 5. ??? Multi-Language Voice Assistant (`/assistant`)
* Full regional language translations for **Odia (?????)**, **Hindi (??????)**, **Bengali (?????)**, **Telugu (??????)**, **Tamil (?????)**, **Kannada (?????)**, **Marathi (?????)**, and **English**.
* Web Speech API microphone input and text-to-speech audio readouts for farmers with limited literacy.

## ?? 5 Advanced Agricultural Intelligence Engines

### 1. ?? Digital Twin Engine (`/digital-twin`)
* Dynamic temporal JSON state of the farm (soil pH 6.4, 0-5cm topsoil moisture %, 10-30cm root-zone moisture %, NPK mg/kg, biomass NDVI, canopy temp, vapor pressure deficit).
* Interactive vertical soil depth horizon viewer (0-5cm Topsoil, 5-15cm Root Zone, 15-30cm Subsoil).
* Live IoT sensor telemetry pulse simulation with real-time graph updates over WebSockets.

### 2. ?? Multi-Agent Consensus System (`/consensus-engine`)
* LangGraph / CrewAI style autonomous agent deliberation theater:
  * ?? **Agronomy & Crop Health Agent**: Yield maximization and leaf area expansion.
  * ??? **Meteorology & Climate Risk Agent**: Radar thunderstorm and runoff risk mitigation.
  * ?? **Hydrology & Irrigation Agent**: Groundwater conservation and Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD).
  * ?? **Agro-Economics & Farmer Budget Agent**: Smallholder input cost minimization.
  * ?? **Consensus Arbiter**: Synthesizes conflicting debates into a Unified Step-by-Step Action Plan with consensus scoring (0-100%).

### 3. ?? Interactive "What-If" Predictive Crop Simulator (`/what-if-simulation`)
* Climate perturbation sandbox with interactive sliders (-3?C to +6?C heatwave, 0 to 25 days drought, flood inundation, irrigation supply, pest outbreak).
* Biophysical modeling projecting 14-day soil moisture decay against the critical 18% wilting threshold, NDVI stress trajectories, and yield/profit impact.

### 4. ?? Agronomy RAG Knowledge Base & Guardrails (`/agronomy-rag`)
* Vector knowledge store grounded in verified research manuals from **ICAR**, **OUAT (Odisha University of Agriculture & Technology)**, and **FAO**.
* Automated safety guardrails enforcing chemical dosage upper-bounds and blocking banned agrochemicals (CIBRC compliance).

### 5. ??? Interactive GIS Field Mapping (`/field-mapping`)
* Leaflet geospatial map to draw field boundary polygon vertices and calculate acreage (Acres, Hectares, Guntha), perimeter, and centroid GPS coordinates.
* Simulated satellite spectral overlays: **NDVI Biomass Spectrum**, **Soil Moisture Band**, and **Disease Risk Zones**.
* One-click plot synchronization to the farmer's Digital Twin.
